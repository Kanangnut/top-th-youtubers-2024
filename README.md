# Objective
<br>
â€¢ Key Pain Point:<br>
The Head of Marketing needs to find the most important TH YouTubers in 2024 to plan and run marketing campaigns for the rest of the year. Without this information, the company might choose less effective influencers. This could make the campaigns less successful and waste marketing resources.<br><br>

â€¢ Ideal Solution:<br>
Create a simple dashboard that shows the top TH YouTubers of 2024. The dashboard should include:<br>

- Subscriber count: To see how popular the YouTuber is.
- Total views: To know how many people watch the YouTuber.
- Total videos: To check how often the YouTuber makes videos.
- Engagement metrics: To see how many likes, comments, and shares the YouTuber gets.
- Content categories: To match the YouTuberâ€™s content with the brand's target audience.
- Audience demographics: To check if the YouTuber's audience is the same as the companyâ€™s target market.
- Growth trends: To find new and popular YouTubers.
- Collaboration history: To see if the YouTuber has worked with other brands before.

### This solution will help the marketing team to:

# Data Source

What data is needed to achieve our objective?

'Top 100 Social Media Influencers 2024 Countrywise'<br>
Where is the data coming from? The data is sourced from Kaggle (an Excel extract), [here is the resource](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavyadhingra00020/top-100-social-media-influencers-2024-countrywise?resource=download)

And we need data on the top TH YouTubers in 2024 that includes:

- channel names
- total subscribers
- total views
- total videos uploaded

So we write the python script to get the data from our data source.

## Dashboard Components Required

- What should the dashboard design based on the requirements?

To determine the components that should be included in the dashboard, we need to identify the key questions that the dashboard must answer:

  1. Who are the top 10 YouTubers with the most subscribers?
  2. Which 3rd channels have uploaded the most videos?
  3. Which 3rd channels have the most views?
  4. Which 3rd channels have the highest average views per video?
  5. Which 3rd channels have the highest views per subscriber ratio?
  6. Which 3rd channels have the highest subscriber engagement rate per video uploaded?

These questions will guide the initial design of the dashboard. As our analysis progresses, additional questions and components may be identified and included.

## Dashboard mockup

Some of the data visuals that may be appropriate in answering our questions include:

  1. Table
  2. Scorecards
  3. Treemap
  4. Horizontal bar chart

These charts will help us show:

- Who the top UK YouTubers are.
- How many subscribers they have.
- How many views they get.
- How many videos they make.

# Development

## Pseudocode

What's the general approach in creating this solution from start to finish?

- Get the data
- Explore the data
- Load the data into SQL Server
- Clean the data with SQL
- Test the data with SQL
- Visualize the data in Power BI
- Generate the findings based on the insights
- Write the documentation + commentary
- Publish the data to GitHub

## Data exploration

This is the stage where we examine the data for errors, inconsistencies, bugs, and unusual or corrupted characters.
Initial Observations:

- There are at least four columns that contain the data needed for this analysis. This suggests we have all the necessary information from the file without needing to contact the client for additional data.
- The first column contains channel IDs, separated by the @ symbol. We need to extract the channel names from this column.
- Some cells and header names are in a different language. We need to confirm if these columns are necessary and address them accordingly.
- There is more data than we need, so some columns will need to be removed.
