## Objective

â€¢ Key Pain Point:
The Head of Marketing needs to find the most important TH YouTubers in 2024 to plan and run marketing campaigns for the rest of the year. Without this information, the company might choose less effective influencers. This could make the campaigns less successful and waste marketing resources.

â€¢ Ideal Solution:
Create a simple dashboard that shows the top UK YouTubers of 2024. The dashboard should include:

- Subscriber count: To see how popular the YouTuber is.
- Total views: To know how many people watch the YouTuber.
- Total videos: To check how often the YouTuber makes videos.
- Engagement metrics: To see how many likes, comments, and shares the YouTuber gets.
- Content categories: To match the YouTuberâ€™s content with the brand's target audience.
- Audience demographics: To check if the YouTuber's audience is the same as the companyâ€™s target market.
- Growth trends: To find new and popular YouTubers.
- Collaboration history: To see if the YouTuber has worked with other brands before.

### This solution will help the marketing team to:
â€¢ Make smart choices when picking YouTubers to work with.
â€¢ Use the budget well by choosing the best influencers.
â€¢ Track how well the partnerships are doing.
â€¢ Find new trends in the TH YouTube scene to stay ahead of competitors.

With this dashboard, the marketing team can improve their influencer marketing strategy. This will lead to better brand awareness, more engagement, and better results from marketing campaigns.
